        <h1>Fascinating and Eccentric Space Realities</h1>

        <h2>Fun and Odd facts about space</h2>
        <p>Space is full of surprises, and these odd facts remind us of the strange 
            and wonderful nature of the cosmos beyond our planet.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Infinite Darkness:</b>
                <p>Space is not completely dark;
                   it's filled with faint background radiation called the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB)
                   that is a remnant of the Big Bang. This radiation is spread evenly throughout the universe.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li><b>Hotter Than the Sun's Surface:</b>
                <p>The corona, the outermost layer of the Sun's atmosphere,
                    is much hotter than its surface. While the surface is around
                    5,500 degrees Celsius (9,932 degrees Fahrenheit),
                    the corona reaches temperatures of millions of degrees Celsius.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li><b>Metal Snow:</b>
                <p>On some planets, like Venus and Mars,
                    it's possible to have "metal snow" in the form of metal frost.
                    These planets experience extremely cold temperatures, 
                    causing metals like lead and bismuth to condense and "snow" onto their surfaces.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li><b>Jellyfish Galaxies:</b>
                <p>Galaxies come in various shapes and sizes, and some are even nicknamed
                    "jellyfish galaxies" due to their appearance. 
                    These galaxies have long tendrils of gas and stars streaming behind them, 
                    resembling the tentacles of a jellyfish.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li><b>Frozen Super-Earth:</b>
                <p> In 2014, astronomers discovered a frozen super-Earth, 
                    named OGLE-2005-BLG-390Lb, which is about five times the mass of Earth 
                    and orbits a distant star. Despite its size, it's so cold that its surface is covered in ice.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li><b>Diamond Stars:</b>
                <p>There's a star known as BPM 37093, or "Lucy," which is essentially a crystallized white dwarf. 
                    Lucy is a massive diamond, with a core made primarily of carbon and oxygen that has 
                    crystallized due to extreme pressure and temperature.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li><b>Vacuum Boiling:</b>
                <p>In the vacuum of space, liquids don't boil as they do on Earth. 
                    Instead, they undergo a process called "vacuum boiling," 
                    where the lack of pressure causes them to transition directly from a liquid to a vapor.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li><b>Water Vapor in Space:</b>
                <p>Water vapor exists in space in various forms, 
                    including in the atmosphere of other planets and as part of the composition 
                    of comets and interstellar clouds. Even distant regions of space contain water molecules.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li><b>Moonquakes:</b>
                <p>Just like earthquakes on Earth, the Moon experiences "moonquakes." 
                    These quakes are usually caused by the gravitational interactions with Earth, 
                    as well as the Moon's own cooling and contracting processes.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li><b>Time Dilation:</b>
                <p>According to Einstein's theory of relativity, time passes more slowly for objects in 
                    strong gravitational fields or at high speeds. This means that astronauts on the 
                    International Space Station experience slightly slower time compared to people on Earth.
                </p>
